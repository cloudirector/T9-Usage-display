It seems overall they use nano-x as the GUI manager. If you want to bit bang raw data to the LCD, /dev/fb0 is your man. You can kill the process that draws to the buffer (nano-X) and it won’t clear it on you anymore, but you’ll lose the backlight control. It’s 128x36px, 1 bit per pixel.

Blank the LCD
    echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank

TV static
    cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0

You can control the backlight yourself, but you’ll need a helper program for it. Cross complies on ubuntu with arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc just fine
    On: ioctl(28, _IOC(0, 0x00, 0xc8, 0x00), 0)
    Off: ioctl(21, _IOC(0, 0x00, 0xc9, 0x00), 0)
        Where 28/21 is just an fd to /dev/fb0

int main() {
return ioctl(open(“/dev/fb0”, O_RDWR), _IOC(0, 0x00, 0xc8, 0x00));
}
